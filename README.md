Cube
====
This is my Cube list, a pool of cards used to play Limited Magic: The Gathering formats using an extremely high-powered Highlander virtual set (the Cube).  

My list has several notable departures from the best-known, but rather than doing an exhaustive comparison, I'd rather talk about the underlying philosophy.

I want the various colors to actually accurately represent what the current color pie allows them to do: including stretches (Nicol Bolas, Planeswalker shouldn't be able to destroy enchantments) is fine, including flagrant violations is not (eg, Sylvan Library).

I want each of the stacks to have depth, allowing diverse archetypes, and to be reasonably balanced.  I will not exclude cards on the basis of being imbalanced as long as they honor the color pie, unless they are also largely non-interactive.  Creatures with Shroud (or Hexproof) are deliberately few in number simply because they tend not to add much depth to a game.

White has a significant "go wide" theme as well as a significant control theme.
